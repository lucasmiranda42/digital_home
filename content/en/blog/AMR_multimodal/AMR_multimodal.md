In 2017 I had the pleasure to join an internship program at the [University of Campinas](https://unicamp.br/en/), in south-east Brazil. After completing my project and courses, I had some small amount of money left, and managed to take some days off in Cabo Frio, close to Rio de Janeiro. It was a great time! But on the very last day, while trying to climb back a cliff after a snorkelling session that had extended for a bit too long, the waves pressed me to the rocks and I cut my leg. While it didn't seem bad in the beginning, it got badly infected and, after several weeks of trying different antibiotics (back in Buenos Aires at this point), the infection was still there. After several tries and some blood analyses, the doctors found something that worked, leaving me only with a pretty big scar and a hopefully engaging introduction to this blog post. Others are not so lucky.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing concern in the medical community. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a global health emergency, and [...]
